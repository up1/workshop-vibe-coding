# Custom Hook Guidelines

This rule outlines the guidelines for creating custom React hooks within this project.

## Custom Hooks

-   **Purpose:** Encapsulate reusable stateful logic, especially for data fetching or complex UI interactions.
-   **Location:** Place custom hooks in the `web/hooks/` directory.
-   **Naming:** Use the `use` prefix (e.g., `useAccounts.ts`).
-   **Data Fetching:** For fetching data from API endpoints, prefer using `useSWR`. Follow the guidelines outlined in [data-fetching.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/data-fetching.mdc).
    -   Create dedicated hooks for specific data types (e.g., `useAccounts`, `useLabels`).
    -   The hook should typically wrap `useSWR`, handle the API endpoint URL, and return the data, loading state, error state, and potentially the `mutate` function from SWR.
-   **Simplicity:** Keep hooks focused on a single responsibility.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a consistent approach to reusable logic and data fetching throughout the application.
