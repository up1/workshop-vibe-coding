# Project Structure
- Fronrend
- Backend

## Main Structure

- Frontend is in `web` folder
- Backend is in `api` folder

```tree
.

├── web/                       # Main frontend
   ├── src/
        ├── components/        # UI components
        ├── api/               # Call REST API from backend
        ├── utils/             # Utilities functions
   

├── api/                       # Main backend
   ├── src/
        ├── routes/            # Router for REST API with expressjs library
        ├── controller/        # Controler functions with expressjs library that called from routes
        ├── service/           # Business or service process that called from controller
        ├── repository/        # Manage data from sqlite database that called from service
        ├── utils/             # Utilities functions

```

## File Naming and Organization

- Use kebab case for route directories (e.g., `api/hello-world/route`)
- Use PascalCase for components (e.g. `components/Button.tsx`)
- Tailwind CSS components are in `components/ui`
- All other components are in `components/`
- Colocate files in the folder where they're used unless they can be used across the app
- If a component can be used in many places, place it in the `components` folder
